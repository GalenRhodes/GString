    /// Splits the given string around matches of the this regular expression.
    ///
    /// The array returned by this method contains each substring of the given string that is terminated by another substring that matches
    /// this expression or is terminated by the end of the string. The substrings in the array are in the order in which they
    /// occur in this string. If this expression does not match any part of the input then the resulting array has just one element,
    /// namely the given string.
    ///
    /// When there is a positive-width match at the beginning of this string then an empty leading substring is included at the
    /// beginning of the resulting array. A zero-width match at the beginning however never produces such empty leading substring.
    ///
    /// The limit parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects the length of the resulting
    /// array. If the limit n is greater than zero then the pattern will be applied at most n - 1 times, the array's length will
    /// be no greater than n, and the array's last entry will contain all input beyond the last matched delimiter. If n is non-positive
    /// then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible and the array can have any length. If n is zero then the
    /// pattern will be applied as many times as possible, the array can have any length, and trailing empty strings will be discarded.
    ///
    /// The string "boo:and:foo", for example, yields the following results with these parameters:
    ///
    /// | Regex | Limit | Result                        |
    /// |:-----:|:-----:|:------------------------------|
    /// |   :   |   2   | { "boo", "and:foo" }          |
    /// |   :   |   5   | { "boo", "and", "foo" }       |
    /// |   :   |  -2   | { "boo", "and", "foo" }       |
    /// |   o   |   5   | { "b", "", ":and:f", "", "" } |
